# ARx 

ARx is a reactive programming language for synchronous connectors. 

You can try it online at [http://arcatools.org/#arx](http://arcatools.org/#arx).

Currently, you can know more about ARx by reading our Coordination'20 [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-50029-0_3), and 
by seeing a short presentation video of ARx at the same conference, following the link in the [slides](http://arca.di.uminho.pt/content/arx-slides-20.pdf).
